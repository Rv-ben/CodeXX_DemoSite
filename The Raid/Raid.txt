The Raid: Background Story
When we were picking groups the one thing
all of us had in common was a desire to create a
video game, of sorts. Suggested by me, we
decided to create a text based game of current
meme.
“T he Raid on Area 51 ”.
At first we pondered on how we would create
this game. In terms of should be a free-roam,
sandbox or if it should even include combat. And
if so, should it be turn-based, live action or a
simple run and avoid attacking enemies. Upon
brainstorming together we came to the
conclusion that due to time restraints (a nd with
the kind, wise and amazing recommendation by
one of our group members ) we would not be
including any combat or free roaming, but
instead a text based adventure game.
Creating this kind of game would be less
time consuming and would still in-feature a
sense of danger but with the concept to avoid
violence. (S ince violence is not always the
answer! ) The player will encounter hostile
enemies throughout the game and must choose
one of the multiple options, to avoid being seen
or captured.
And to include, at the beginning of the game
one would notice that you the player, has the
option to choose one of the pre-created
characters to play as. They all have pro’s and
con’s as they can all either succeed or fail, in
their mission to raid Area 51. Each character
has a different set of skills that they can use in
situations that apply to them. Also take note that
your character can die, your decisions matter!
So choose wisely.~
In other words, our project is a sweet kind-hearted game, that
we put in all our effort in. It’s packed full with laughable memes and
funny jokes all over.
Please feel free to play and be weary of the choices you make!
