                  How was it made?
                  This game was made with the Godot software, which is a game engine and open source software released by MIT. The Godot software has its own godot language to program the games, however the syntax is similar to python. Together we worked together and made the game.

                  About the Game
                  Introducing a game brought to you by a team of three girls, designed for
                  people of all ages learn how to take care of a virtual baby. This game is great
                  for children who are becoming older siblings, new parents that want to
                  practice taking care of a baby, or anyone interested in playing with a baby.
                  Users are able to choose the name and gender and to make it fun we coded
                  pictures from the delivery of the baby to feeding and sleeping. We hope that
                  this game can be informational and bring knowledge to users, especially
                  through the quick tips included after each level. We hope that users will have a
                  fun experience feeding, sleeping, and caring for their virtual baby with our
                  game.
